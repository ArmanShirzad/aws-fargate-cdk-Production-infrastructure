# Project Summary

## Overview
Production-ready AWS infrastructure for deploying containerized Python APIs using AWS CDK. This project demonstrates enterprise-grade cloud architecture suitable for AI/ML model serving, microservices, and scalable web applications.

## Key Highlights

### AWS Services Demonstrated
✅ **Amazon ECS Fargate** - Container orchestration  
✅ **Application Load Balancer** - Traffic distribution  
✅ **Amazon VPC** - Multi-AZ networking  
✅ **CloudWatch** - Logging and monitoring  
✅ **Secrets Manager** - Secure credential storage  
✅ **SSM Parameter Store** - Configuration management  
✅ **CodeDeploy** - Blue/green deployments  
✅ **IAM** - Security and access control  
✅ **CloudFormation** - Infrastructure management  

### Technical Skills
✅ **Infrastructure as Code** - AWS CDK with Python  
✅ **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions with OIDC  
✅ **Containerization** - Docker  
✅ **Observability** - Custom CloudWatch dashboards  
✅ **Security** - Least privilege, OIDC authentication  
✅ **Auto-scaling** - CPU and request-based scaling  
✅ **High Availability** - Multi-AZ deployment  

### Production Features
- Multi-AZ VPC deployment across 3 availability zones
- Auto-scaling from 1 to 5 tasks based on load
- Health checks and automatic task replacement
- VPC Flow Logs for network security auditing
- CloudWatch dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Blue/green deployment support for zero-downtime updates
- Secrets management for secure credential handling

### Architecture Decisions
- **ECS Fargate over EC2**: Simplified container management, auto-scaling
- **Application Load Balancer**: Layer 7 routing, advanced health checks
- **Private subnets for tasks**: Enhanced security, NAT for outbound access
- **CDK over CloudFormation**: Programmatic infrastructure, better developer experience
- **GitHub Actions OIDC**: Eliminates need for long-lived AWS credentials

## Use Cases
- AI/ML model serving and inference APIs
- Microservices architecture
- Scalable web applications
- Production API backends
- High-availability service deployments

## Cost Considerations
Estimated monthly cost for 24/7 operation: $70-80 USD
- NAT Gateway: ~$32/month
- Application Load Balancer: ~$16/month
- ECS Fargate (1 task): ~$15/month
- CloudWatch: ~$5/month
- Cost optimized through auto-scaling and pay-per-use model
